# Transformer Network

This model is inspired from the [transformer network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) from 'Attention is all you need'. There are some major differences between our model and the model in the paper (for reading material goto `/readings` folder).

## Run Model


## Files

The transformer network has the following files:

1. `network.py`: Network architecture class, this only holds the crucial functions. As many as possible functions have been pushed to seperate files.

2. `model_config.py`: Configuration values to run the model and operate it end to end.

3. `core_layers.py`: All the network layers to build the model.
